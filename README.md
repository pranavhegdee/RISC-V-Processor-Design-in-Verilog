# ðŸš€ RISC-V Core (Custom Implementation)

A custom **RISC-V processor core** designed in **Verilog** with full support for the base **RV32I instruction set**.  
The project focuses on modular architecture and extensibility, enabling future enhancements such as pipelining, hazard detection, and custom instruction extensions.  
It has been tested with assembly programs and simulation waveforms.
