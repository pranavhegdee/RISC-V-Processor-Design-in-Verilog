# RISC-V-Processor-Design-in-Verilog
A custom RISC-V processor core designed in Verilog with full support for the base RV32I instruction set. Built with modular architecture for extensibility (e.g., pipelining, hazard detection, forwarding). Verified using assembly test programs and simulation waveforms.
